## Alert Triggers

### Data Sources

Alerts are triggered by multiple data sources:

#### NHC Forecast Cones
- Real-time hurricane forecast cone data
- Geometric intersection with your location
- Storm type and intensity analysis
- Advisory updates and changes

#### NWS Watches and Warnings
- Official Hurricane Watch/Warning
- Tropical Storm Watch/Warning
- Storm Surge Watch/Warning
- Evacuation orders

#### AI Analysis
- NOAA map interpretation
- Storm development assessment
- Trajectory analysis
- Threat level evaluation

#### Storm Proximity
- Distance-based threat calculation
- Time-to-impact estimation
- Storm intensity consideration
- Movement speed analysis

### Alert Logic

The system uses sophisticated logic to determine alert levels:

```python
# Simplified alert logic
if has_hurricane_warning:
    return Level 5  # Hurricane Warning
elif has_tropical_storm_warning or has_hurricane_watch or has_evacuation_order:
    return Level 4  # Evacuation Zone
elif has_tropical_storm_watch or (in_hurricane_cone and days_until_impact <= 5):
    return Level 3  # TS Watch/Hurricane Threat
elif in_disturbance_cone or (storm_nearby and days_until_impact <= 7):
    return Level 2  # Tropical Storm Threat
else:
    return Level 1  # All Clear
```

```

## Alert Management

### Cooldown System

To prevent alert spam, Weatherbot implements a configurable cooldown system:

```env
ALERT_COOLDOWN_MINUTES=60  # Wait 60 minutes between duplicate alerts
```

**Behavior**:
- Prevents duplicate alerts for the same threat level
- Allows escalation to higher alert levels
- Resets when threat level decreases
- Configurable based on monitoring frequency

**Recommended Settings**:
- **Continuous monitoring**: 60-120 minutes
- **Scheduled checks**: 30-60 minutes
- **Testing/development**: 0 minutes (no cooldown)

### State Management

Weatherbot maintains persistent state to track:

- **Last alert time**: Prevents spam
- **Storm advisories**: Tracks new updates
- **Alert IDs**: Prevents duplicate NWS alerts
- **In-cone status**: Tracks location threat status

**State File**: `state/weatherbot_state.json`

**Management Commands**:
```bash
# View current state
weatherbot state show

# Clear state (reset all tracking)
weatherbot state clear
```

### Alert Deduplication

The system prevents duplicate alerts through:

1. **Cooldown periods**: Time-based alert limiting
2. **Advisory tracking**: Only alert on new storm advisories
3. **Alert ID tracking**: Prevent duplicate NWS alerts
4. **Threat level changes**: Only alert on escalation or new threats

## Customization

### Location-Specific Guidance

Alerts are customized based on your location:

```python
# Miami, FL example
guidance = (
    f"Hurricane Watch issued for Miami-Dade County. "
    f"Evacuation zones A and B should evacuate immediately. "
    f"Storm surge of 6-10 feet expected along Biscayne Bay."
)

# Generic example
guidance = (
    f"Hurricane Watch issued for your location. "
    f"Follow local evacuation orders if issued. "
    f"Prepare for dangerous storm surge and winds."
)
```

### AI-Enhanced Alerts

When OpenAI API key is configured, alerts include:

- **Intelligent analysis**: AI interpretation of weather maps
- **Location context**: Specific geographic considerations
- **Personalized recommendations**: Based on local conditions
- **Storm evolution**: Predicted development and changes

### County-Level Detection

For more precise alerts in complex coastal areas:

```env
USE_COUNTY_INTERSECT=true
COUNTY_GEOJSON_PATH=path/to/county.geojson
```

**Benefits**:
- More accurate threat detection for large counties
- Better handling of complex coastlines
- Reduced false positives for inland areas
- Customizable threat zones

## Testing Alerts

### Test Command

```bash
weatherbot test-alert
```

**What it tests**:
- Toast notification system
- Sound playback
- Alert formatting
- System permissions

**Expected behavior**:
- Toast notification appears
- Alert sound plays
- Success message in console
- No errors in logs

### Manual Testing

Create test scenarios by temporarily modifying coordinates:

```env
# Test with coordinates in active storm area
HOME_LAT=26.0000
HOME_LON=-80.0000
```

```bash
weatherbot run --once --verbose
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Alerts Received

**Symptoms**:
- No toast notifications
- No console alerts
- Silent operation

**Solutions**:
1. Check `weatherbot test-alert`
2. Verify coordinates with `weatherbot check-coverage`
3. Check cooldown settings (`ALERT_COOLDOWN_MINUTES`)
4. Review logs: `logs/weatherbot.log`
5. Ensure active storms in area

#### False Alerts

**Symptoms**:
- Alerts when no storms present
- Incorrect threat levels
- Outdated information

**Solutions**:
1. Verify coordinate accuracy
2. Check NOAA coverage status
3. Clear cache: `weatherbot debug clear-cache`
4. Update to latest version
5. Review state: `weatherbot state show`

#### Missing High-Level Alerts

**Symptoms**:
- No Level 4/5 alerts during major storms
- Delayed notifications
- Inconsistent alerting

**Solutions**:
1. Check NWS alert integration
2. Verify storm advisory updates
3. Review geometric intersection logic
4. Enable verbose logging
5. Check API connectivity

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check current storm data
weatherbot debug storm-data

# View NHC layers
weatherbot debug layers

# Test AI analysis
weatherbot debug test-ai

# Clear all caches
weatherbot debug clear-cache
```

### Log Analysis

Enable debug logging for detailed information:

```env
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

```bash
weatherbot run --verbose
```

**Key log entries**:
- Configuration loading
- Storm data retrieval
- Geometric analysis results
- Alert triggering logic
- Notification delivery

## Best Practices

### Setup Recommendations

1. **Accurate coordinates**: Use precise location coordinates
2. **Test notifications**: Verify alerts work before hurricane season
3. **Appropriate cooldown**: Balance between spam prevention and timely alerts
4. **Regular updates**: Keep Weatherbot updated to latest version
5. **Backup configuration**: Save `.env` file securely

### Monitoring Strategy

1. **Hurricane season**: Run every 2-4 hours
2. **Active threats**: Run every 1-2 hours
3. **Scheduled tasks**: Use `--once` flag
4. **Manual checks**: Use `ai-analysis` command during uncertainty

### Emergency Preparedness

1. **Review evacuation routes**: Know multiple exit paths
2. **Emergency supplies**: Maintain 7-day supply kit
3. **Communication plan**: Establish family contact methods
4. **Important documents**: Keep copies in waterproof container
5. **Stay informed**: Monitor official emergency services

### AI Usage Tips

1. **API costs**: Monitor OpenAI usage and set limits
2. **Accuracy**: AI enhances but doesn't replace official alerts
3. **Global coverage**: Essential for locations outside NOAA coverage
4. **Verification**: Cross-reference AI analysis with official sources

## Integration

### Automation Scripts

Example PowerShell script for Windows Task Scheduler:

```powershell
# weatherbot_monitor.ps1
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

try {
    # Activate virtual environment
    & "E:\Code\Python\venvs\weatherbot\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
    
    # Run weatherbot
    weatherbot run --once
    
    Write-Host "Weatherbot monitoring completed successfully"
}
catch {
    Write-Error "Weatherbot monitoring failed: $_"
    exit 1
}
```

### Third-Party Integration

**Home Assistant**:
```yaml
# configuration.yaml
command_line:
  - sensor:
      name: "Hurricane Alert Level"
      command: "weatherbot ai-analysis --json"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.alert_level }}"
      scan_interval: 3600
```

**IFTTT/Zapier**:
- Trigger on log file changes
- Parse alert levels from output
- Send to additional notification services

### API Integration

For custom applications, use Weatherbot as a Python library:

```python
from weatherbot.enhanced_cone_analyzer import analyze_location_threat_enhanced
from weatherbot.config import load_config

config = load_config()
threat_analysis = analyze_location_threat_enhanced(
    latitude=config.home_lat,
    longitude=config.home_lon,
)

alert_level = threat_analysis["alert_level"]
if alert_level.value >= 3:
    # Trigger custom notifications
    send_custom_alert(alert_level, threat_analysis)
```
